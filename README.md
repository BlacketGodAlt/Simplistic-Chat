One of the most simplistic multi-person chats. This chat uses a JavaScript frontend and a Node.js backend. (NOTE: This chat is currently in BETA testing. Expect bugs!)
### Steps to run:
#### Github Codespaces
1. Create a new codespace on main.
2. Run `node server.js` and click **Make Public** on the popup.
3. Navigate to the **Ports** tab, right click the link, and click **Open in Browser** to launch the chat.
